            <!-- highlight key words with light accent -->
            <p style = "text-align: justify;">I am a third-year student studying a Bachelor of Computer Science at Western Sydney University, intending to graduate by June 2024. I aim to advance my programming skills and knowledge by engaging in projects that challenge and interest me.</p>
            <p>I began studying a Bachelor of Engineering at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand in 2020. Once I moved to Australia in 2022, I switched to computer science as it aligned more with my interests.</p>
            <p>I have learnt a variety of subjects including computer networking, hardware and architecture, object-oriented programming in both Python and C++, database management systems, and algorithms and structures. I also have a strong mathematical background as I have completed two years worth of engineering mathematics courses.</p>
